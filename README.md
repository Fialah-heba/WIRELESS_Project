## **AI-Powered Web Application for Wireless and Mobile Network Design**

Develop and deploy a web-based application integrated with an AI agent that collects user-defined parameters, performs computations for wireless and mobile network design scenarios, and provides detailed, user-friendly explanations of the results using a Large Language Model (LLM) API. The application will support four key scenarios: wireless communication systems, Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems, link budget calculations, and cellular system design. The AI agent will validate user inputs, compute required parameters, and explain the methodology and results in natural language.

### **The application will handle the following scenarios:**
**1. Wireless Communication System:** Compute the rate at the output of each of the following blocks; the sampler, quantizer, source encoder, channel encoder, interleaver, and burst formating.

**2. OFDM Systems:** Calculate the data rates for resource elements, OFDM symbols, resource blocks, maximum transmission capacity using parallel resource blocks, and spectral efficiency.

**3. Link Budget Calculation:** Compute the transmitted power and received signal strength in a flat environment based on transmitter and receiver specifications.

**4. Cellular System Design:** Design a cellular network based on user-specified parameters.
